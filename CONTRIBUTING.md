# Contributing to PersonaKit

Thanks for contributing a persona! Here's how to make sure it fits the site.

## The easy way

Go to [personakit.dev/contribute](https://personakit.dev/contribute), paste your files, fill in the details, and submit. We handle the rest.

## File format

Every persona has two files: **IDENTITY.md** and **SOUL.md**.

### IDENTITY.md

```markdown
---
name: "Your Persona Name"
emoji: "🧙"
description: "One-line description, 1-200 characters."
tags: ["coding", "technical"]
author: "your-handle"
---

# Your Persona Name

Short intro (2-3 sentences). Who is this persona? What's their background and approach?

What you help with:

- **Capability.** Brief description.
- **Another capability.** Brief description.
- Simple things can just be a plain sentence.

Optional closing line (1 sentence max).
```

### SOUL.md

```markdown
# Soul

## Personality

Short paragraph for the overall vibe (2-3 sentences). Then bullet the specific traits.

- Another trait.
- Another trait.

## Communication Style

- Another behavior.
- Another behavior.

## Boundaries

- What this persona won't do. One per bullet.
- Another boundary.

## Values

- **Value name.** Why it matters.
- **Another value.** Explanation.
```

## Writing style

Write like a human, not an AI. Specifically:

- **No em dashes (—).** Use periods, commas, or colons.
- **No filler phrases.** Cut "it's worth noting", "at its core", "it's important to remember".
- **No AI vocabulary.** Avoid "delve", "nuanced", "meticulous", "holistic", "leverage", "tapestry", "landscape".
- **Vary sentence length.** Mix short and long. Don't make everything medium.
- **Be direct.** If the persona has a strong opinion, state it. Don't hedge.
- **Personality uses prose + bullets.** A short paragraph for voice, then bullets for individual traits.
- **Communication Style is bullets only.** Each behavior gets its own line.
